# stl_remakes

This project is for anyone trying to write C++ applications that do not utilize CRT and by extension; STL.

I saw nothing out there that was a very bare-bones level of STL, so I decided to make my own that was sort of light-weight.

Keep in mind, some improvements can be made, most of these were made in the knick of time and not via any rush.
